Write a function called factorial that takes in num as a parameter and returns the factorial value. Ignore checking numbers that are less than 1. 
For example, factorial(5) would return 120.

def factorial(num):
    fac = 1
    for i in range(1, num + 1):
        fac *= i
    return fac
	factorial(5)
