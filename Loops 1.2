Write a function called draw_square that takes in num as a parameter and returns a string that consists of a square made of “*” with the dimensions num times num. 
Note: ignore values that are less than or equal to zero. For example, draw_square(4) would return "****\n****\n****\n****".

def draw_square(num):
    string = ""
    for i in range(num):
        if i < (num - 1):
            string += "*" * num + "\n"
        else:
            string += "*" * num
    return string
draw_square(4)
