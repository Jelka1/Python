Write a function called sentence_without_vowels that takes in string as a parameter and returns a new string that consists of only characters that are not vowels. 
For example, sentence_without_vowels('apple') would return "ppl".

def sentence_without_vowels(string):
    str = ""
    for item in string:
        if item in "aeiou": continue
        str += item
    return str
  
sentence_without_vowels('apple')
sentence_without_vowels('soup')
